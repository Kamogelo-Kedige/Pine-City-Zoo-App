                <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                <!-- Giraffe description -->
                <p>
                    The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living
                    terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and its
                    leopard-like colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and
                    legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family
                    Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. The nine subspecies are distinguished
                    by their coat patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from
                    Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open
                    woodlands. Their primary food source is acacia leaves, which they browse at heights most other
                    herbivores cannot reach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Giraffes are preyed on by lions; their calves are also targeted by leopards, spotted hyenas, and
                    African wild dogs. Adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose
                    aggregations if they happen to be moving in the same general direction. Males establish social
                    hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant
                    males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.

                </p>
                <p>
                    You will find the giraffes at G15, just beyond the research centre.
