                <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                <p>
                    Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forests of central
                    Africa. The eponymous genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the
                    western gorillas, and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates by
                    physical size. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on
                    what is counted, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and
                    bonobos.


                </p>

                <p>
                    Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa. Although their range
                    covers a small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla
                    inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from
                    2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland
                    swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African
                    countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its
                    border with Rwanda.

                    You will find the gorilla cage at GO12.
