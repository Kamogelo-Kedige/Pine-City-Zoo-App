                <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                <p>
                    Wild tigers, the largest members of the big cat family, are now primarily confined to isolated
                    pockets across Asia. Historically, these majestic predators roamed vast regions—from the snowy
                    forests of Siberia and northern China to the tropical jungles of India and Southeast Asia—but
                    widespread human encroachment and environmental changes have drastically limited their natural
                    range.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, the tiger is classified as an endangered species, with populations having plummeted by over
                    90% compared to their historic numbers. Threats such as habitat loss, illegal poaching, and
                    human-wildlife conflict have taken a heavy toll, leaving subspecies like the Bengal, Amur, and
                    Sumatran tigers particularly vulnerable. Robust conservation measures are now critical to preserving
                    these iconic animals and ensuring their survival in the wild.
