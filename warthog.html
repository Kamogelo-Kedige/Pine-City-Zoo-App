                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>
                    Phacochoerus is a genus of wild pigs in the family Suidae, known as warthogs. It is the sole genus
                    of subfamily Phacochoerinae. They are found in open and semiopen habitats, even in quite arid
                    regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the
                    scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the
                    best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog) is Phacochoerus
                    africanus.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with
                    only the crest along the back, and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. The
                    English name refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. They also
                    have very distinct tusks, which reach a length of 25.5 to 63.5 cm (10.0 to 25.0 in) in the males,
                    but are always smaller in the females. They are largely herbivorous, but occasionally also eat small
                    animal food. While both species remain fairly common and widespread, and therefore are considered to
                    be of Least Concern by the IUCN, the nominate subspecies of the desert warthog, commonly known as
                    the Cape warthog, became extinct around 1865.

                    You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.
